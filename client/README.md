**Technologies and libraries:**

## File structure

I didn't use a particular file structure, but it’s similar to the one mentioned in: https://es.reactjs.org/docs/faq-structure.html#grouping-by-file-type called “grouping by type file” where the idea is to group similar files. For example:

- api
- assets
- components
- pages
- test
